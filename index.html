          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
            For small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), driving revenue growth
            and improving customer conversion rates is a constant priority. Yet,
            hiring a full-time Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) is often not
            financially viable.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
            RapidRise Advisory offers a flexible alternative. As a Fractional
            CRO, I provide SMBs with senior-level revenue leadership on a
            part-time, interim, or ongoing basis. With over 25 years of
            experience in sales, business development, and customer success, I
            bring a proven ability to design and execute effective go-to-market
            (GTM) strategies, strengthen sales performance, align marketing, and
            improve client retention.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
            I have worked alongside sales, customer success, and marketing teams
            across multiple industries, helping businesses sharpen their
            positioning, unlock new growth opportunities, and scale sustainably.
            My Fractional CRO service is adaptable - whether your business needs
            short-term guidance during a leadership gap, or sustained strategic
            support without the expense of a full-time executive.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
            With RapidRise Advisory, you gain direct access to one trusted

            <p>
              Engaging a Fractional CRO can be the right move in many business
              situations. At RapidRise, I step in to provide leadership and
              expertise when:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
              <li>
                Sales leadership is underperforming and requires hands-on
                coaching and mentoring to get back on track.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sales or Sales Operations leadership needs replacing and the
                business requires an experienced professional to take the reins.
              </li>
              <li>
                Existing leaders are strong operationally or within their
                industry, but lack the strategic perspective and breadth of
                experience needed to drive growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Leadership has vision but not capacity. They need a trusted
                sales leader to take ownership of day-to-day responsibilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                The current operating model has reached its limit, and
                leadership needs support to step back, rethink, and elevate
                performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                A CRO vacancy arises unexpectedly, and an experienced interim
                leader is needed to stabilize the business while a permanent
                hire is secured.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With RapidRise, you gain direct access to one seasoned expert who
              can step in quickly, provide stability, and deliver the strategic

            <p>
              The first step in working with RapidRise is to clearly define the
              needs of your sales organization and the scope of work. I start
              with a discovery discussion to understand your challenges, goals,
              and expectations. If there’s a strong fit, we then agree on the
              exact role, responsibilities, and outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, we also set practical details such as timeframes, level
              of involvement, and the number of dedicated days or hours per
              month. Every engagement is flexible, tailored, and scalable to
              meet the specific needs of your business.
            </p>
