            <div class="text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-4">
                <p>For small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), driving revenue growth and improving customer conversion rates is a constant priority. Yet, hiring a full-time Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) is often not financially viable.</p>
                <p>RapidRise Advisory offers a flexible alternative. As a Fractional CRO, I provide SMBs with senior-level revenue leadership on a part-time, interim, or ongoing basis. With over 25 years of experience in sales, business development, and customer success, I bring a proven ability to design and execute effective **go-to-market (GTM) strategies**, strengthen **sales performance**, align **marketing**, and improve **client retention**.</p>
                <p>I have worked alongside sales, customer success, and marketing teams across multiple industries, helping businesses sharpen their positioning, unlock new growth opportunities, and scale sustainably. My Fractional CRO service is adaptable - whether your business needs short-term guidance during a leadership gap, or sustained strategic support without the expense of a full-time executive.</p>
                <p>With RapidRise Advisory, you gain direct access to one trusted expert dedicated to accelerating revenue, shaping winning go-to-market strategies, and helping your business achieve long-term growth.</p>
