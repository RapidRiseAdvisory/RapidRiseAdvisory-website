              What can a Fractional CRO do for your business?
            </h3>
            <div class="text-gray-600 space-y-4">
              <p>
                A Fractional or Interim CRO can bring a sharp, results-driven
                focus to your sales funnel. At RapidRise Advisory, I assess both
                the top and bottom of the funnel to ensure that every stage of
                the sales process and customer journey is working at its best.
              </p>
              <p>
                An effective CRO understands how buyers think and what shapes
                their experience. As a Fractional CRO, I bring this perspective
                into your business—helping to refine processes, improve
                conversion rates, and strengthen customer relationships.
              </p>
              <p>
                For organizations that are not yet fully data-driven in sales or
                customer support, I introduce the right metrics, insights, and
                strategies tailored to your business. In addition, I collaborate
                closely with marketing to develop and execute lead generation
                strategies that align with your overall growth goals.
              </p>

              When Does a Fractional CRO Make Sense?

              <p>
                Engaging a Fractional CRO can be the right move in many business
                situations. At RapidRise, I step in to provide leadership and
                expertise when:

              <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>
                  Sales leadership is underperforming and requires hands-on
                  coaching and mentoring to get back on track.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sales or Sales Operations leadership needs replacing and the
                  business requires an experienced professional to take the
                  reins.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Existing leaders are strong operationally or within their
                  industry, but lack the strategic perspective and breadth of
                  experience needed to drive growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Leadership has vision but not capacity. They need a trusted
                  sales leader to take ownership of day-to-day responsibilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The current operating model has reached its limit, and
                  leadership needs support to step back, rethink, and elevate
                  performance.
                </li>

                  A CRO vacancy arises unexpectedly, and an experienced interim
                  leader is needed to stabilize the business while a permanent

              How to Engage a Fractional CRO

            <div class="text-gray-600 space-y-4">
              <p>
                The first step in working with RapidRise is to clearly define
                the needs of your sales organization and the scope of work. I
                start with a discovery discussion to understand your challenges,
                goals, and expectations. If there’s a strong fit, we then agree
                on the exact role, responsibilities, and outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Together, we also set practical details such as timeframes,
                level of involvement, and the number of dedicated days or hours
                per month. Every engagement is flexible, tailored, and scalable
                to meet the specific needs of your business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fractional and Interim CRO services through RapidRise are a
                smart option for SMBs, startups, and businesses in transition or
                growth mode—providing senior leadership without the long-term
